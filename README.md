# Insurance-Prediction
This project builds a machine learning model to predict health insurance costs based on user demographics and health-related features. The dataset used includes attributes such as age, BMI, number of children, smoking habits, and region.
Key Features:
Input Features: Age, Sex, BMI, Children, Smoker, Region
Model: Linear Regression
Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Performance Metrics: Mean Squared Error, R² Score
How It Works:
The dataset is pre-processed (e.g., categorical encoding for the smoker and region columns).
The model is trained on 80% of the data and tested on the remaining 20%.
Predictions are made using a simple linear regression algorithm.
Model performance is evaluated using error metrics such as MSE and R² score.
Instructions:
Clone the repository.
Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the health_insurance_prediction.py script to train and evaluate the model.
